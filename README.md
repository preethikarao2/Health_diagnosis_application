# Health Diagnosis Application
## About
This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
* Diabetes
* Breast Cancer
* Malaria
* Pneumonia

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction
Disease | Type of Model | Accuracy
--- | --- | ---
Diabetes | Machine Learning Model | 98.25%
Breast Cancer | Machine Learning Model | 95.47%
Malaria | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%
Pneumonia | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95%



## Steps to run the WebApp in local Computer
**Step-1:** Download the files in the repository.<br>
**Step-2:** Get into the downloaded folder, open command prompt in that directory and install all the dependencies using following command<br>
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step-3:** After successfull installation of all the dependencies, run the following command<br>
```python
python app.py
```
